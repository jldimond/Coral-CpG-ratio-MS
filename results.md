_**Predicted Gene Methylation**_    
Germline methylation patterns in the transcriptomes of six scleractinian coral species were determined. Germline methylation levels were inferred based on the hypermutability of methylated cytosines, which tend towards conversion to thymines over evolutionary time. This results in a reduction in CpG dinucleotides, meaning that historically heavily methylated genomic regions are associated with reduced numbers of CpGs. Specifically the CpG observed / expected ratio (CpG O/E) was determined for individual genes (contigs) using the following formula: `{CpG O/E = (number of CpG / number of C x number of G) x (l^2/l-1)}` where l is the number of nucleotides in the contig.
Coral transcriptomes examined include those from Acropora hyacinthus, A. millepora, A. palmata, Montastraea faveolata, Stylophora pistillata, and Pocillopora damicornis.

_**Transcriptome Annotation**_   
In order to ensure consistency in annotation across all available transcriptomes, each transcriptome was compared to UniProt/Swiss-prot database using Blastx. Protein annotations were determined by best protein match using an evalue threshold 1x10E-5.  SQLShare was used to join annotation results with associated GO terms (Gene Ontology database: http://www.geneontology.org) to categorize genes into parent categories and assign them a functional group based on the MGI GO Slim database (URL:http://www.informatics.jax.org). All code used for transcriptome annotation is available (URLURLURL).
