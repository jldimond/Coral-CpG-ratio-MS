## jupyter (IPython) notebooks
These notebooks detail analysis procedures and can be rendered natively within GitHub by clicking on them. Notebook files start with the species prefix and end with either "_blast_anno.ipynb" or "_CpG_ratio.ipynb". The former performs an annotation of the transcriptome, while the latter analyzes CpG O/E.
