#ABSTRACT

DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that plays an important yet inadequately understood role in gene regulation, particularly in non-model species. Because it can be influenced by the environment and potentially transferred to subsequent generations, DNA methylation may contribute to the ability of organisms to acclimatize and adapt to environmental change. Here we will evaluate the distribution of gene body methylation in reef-building corals, a group of organisms facing a number of significant environmental challenges. Gene body methylation in six species of corals will be inferred from in silico transcriptome analysis of CpGo/e ratios, which are highly correlated with patterns of methylation enrichment. Consistent with what has been documented in other invertebrates, preliminary results suggest that hypermethylated genes are those with housekeeping functions, while hypomethylated genes tend to have inducible functions. We will therefore also test the hypothesis that genes that are differentially expressed in response to environmental change tend to be sparsely methylated. This may yield insight into the potential role of methylation in mediating phenotypic plasticity and acclimatization.
