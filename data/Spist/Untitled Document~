The FASTA file Spist.fasta is a *Stylophora pistillata* transcriptome downloaded from http://data.centrescientifique.mc/Data/454Isotigs.fas.zip on 2/17/2015. It was featured in an article by [Karako-Lampert et al. 2014](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088615). The transcriptome was developed from adult coral tissue. Samples were pooled from a number of depths, temperature conditions, and pH conditions to increase the breadth of gene expression represented.

The file Spist_diff is a list of differentially expressed genes in response to temperature stress. The list is derived from a [supplementary file](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12592/asset/supinfo/gcb12592-sup-0001-SupportingInformation.docx?v=1&s=c9a2d3ef0adfb573a268323547a514b32fa0186d) featured in an article by [Maor-Landaw et al. 2014](onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12592/abstract). The data were generated in a microarray experiment. So far I have not been able to find full contig sequences using the reported sequence IDs.
