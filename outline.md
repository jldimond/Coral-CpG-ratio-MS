#Outline

##Introduction

-Start with phenotypic plasticity? Or go right into epigenetics and DNA methylation?
-DNA methylation in general
-DNA methylation in invertebrates: gene body methylation, functions, potential role in phenotypic plasticity
-DNA methylation in corals and why it is of interest: potential basis of phenotypic plasticity/acclimatization/resilience to env change
-Introduce objectives of the study: explore patterns of germline methylation in coral transcriptomes and env response genes

##Methods

-Description of datasets, including table
-Description of methods used to annotate transcriptomes
-Description of methods used to calculate CpG and analyze graphically/statistically

##Results

-First discuss whole transcriptome results, including transcriptome-wide patterns (density plots) and patterns by GOslim bin (bar plots)
-Then discuss results for env response genes, including overall patterns (density plots)
